This a program that automates the work with YouTube, which the author (Nakama) often did manually and it took a lot of time. For example, downloading a video from YouTube. It is not always possible to download a video through y2mate: either the link is not found, or the video is not being converted, or the download window is just not displayed, sometimes it takes a long time to wait, often the resource changes the name of the video or even spoils it. Everything is bad. This script allows: 1) Quickly download videos from YouTube without problems and changing the name; 2) Rename any files in the directory; 3) Extract audio from video; 4) Download immediately audio from YouTube. Use whoever needs it. Hint: as a separator, choose those characters that cannot be used in the title of the file, in case you have to enter this character in the file title, so that there would be no problems later.
